  /**
   * Test 1 — mocking Reset Chat
   *   1. Register a route for "**\/api/messages" that fulfills with
   *      `{ messages: [] }` (register every route before `page.goto`).
   *   2. Register a route for "**\/api/reset" that fulfills with
   *      `{ status: 'ok' }` — that's the only response shape
   *      `resetChat()` (src/api/chatApi.ts) accepts as success.
   *   3. Go to "/", wait for data-testid="chat-input" to be enabled (15s
   *      timeout), then send "Bananas are great" through the normal
   *      fill+click flow (funny mode stays on — no need to mock
   *      POST /api/chat for this test) and wait for the assistant reply to
   *      appear.
   *   4. Click data-testid="reset-button" — clicking it clears the on-screen
   *      thread immediately either way (it doesn't wait on the network
   *      call), so pair the click with `page.waitForResponse('**\/api/reset')`
   *      (same `Promise.all([...])` shape demo.spec.ts uses for
   *      POST /api/chat) to actually confirm *your mock* was hit, and
   *      assert its status is 200.
   *   5. Assert there are 0 data-testid="message-user" elements, 0
   *      data-testid="message-assistant" elements, and that "No messages
   *      yet." is visible again.

   * Test 2 — a slow response and the loading indicator
   *   1. Register a route for "**\/api/messages" that fulfills with
   *      `{ messages: [] }`.
   *   2. Register a route for "**\/api/chat" whose handler *waits* (e.g.
   *      `await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 500))`) before calling
   *      `route.fulfill(...)` with a mocked `{ reply: {...} }` — an
   *      assistant `Message` (id, role: 'assistant', content, timestamp)
   *      of your choosing.
   *   3. Go to "/", wait for the chat input to be enabled, then uncheck
   *      data-testid="funny-mode-toggle" (a real request only fires with
   *      funny mode off).
   *   4. Fill the chat input with any text and click Send.
   *   5. Assert data-testid="loading-indicator" is visible — this has to
   *      win the race against your 500ms delay, so assert it right after
   *      clicking Send, before any other assertion.
   *   6. Assert the last data-testid="message-assistant" has the exact
   *      text you mocked in step 2.
   *   7. Assert data-testid="loading-indicator" now has a count of 0.

  /**
   * Test 3 — asserting the request, not the reply
   *   1. Register a route for "**\/api/messages" that fulfills with
   *      `{ messages: [] }`.
   *   2. Register a route for "**\/api/chat" whose handler, before
   *      fulfilling, captures the outgoing request into a variable declared
   *      in the test: `route.request().postDataJSON()` (and, separately,
   *      `route.request().method()`). Fulfill with any mocked
   *      `{ reply: {...} }`.
   *   3. Go to "/", wait for the chat input, uncheck the funny mode toggle,
   *      and send "Ostriches assemble".
   *   4. Wait for your mocked reply to show up on screen first — the route
   *      handler runs asynchronously, so asserting on the captured variable
   *      before the reply renders can read it while it's still undefined.
   *   5. Assert the captured method is "POST" and the captured body equals
   *      `{ message: 'Ostriches assemble' }` exactly (toEqual) — the
   *      contract `src/api/chatApi.ts` promises. Note it sends `message`,
   *      not `text` or `content`: a mocked reply renders either way, so
   *      only this assertion can catch it if that ever changes.
