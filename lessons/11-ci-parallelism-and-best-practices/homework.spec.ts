 * Screens under test: no screen for the first exercise (it's pure retry
 * mechanics, like demo.spec.ts's); Chat ("/") → Search ("/search") for the
 * second, organized into test.step()s.
 *
 * Complete the exercise below. It's split into three tests plus one task
 * that isn't a test at all — write each one, deleting its `test.fixme()`
 * line once it passes.
 *
 * Note on Test 1: once it's complete, running it won't print a plain
 * "passed" — it fails on attempt 1, then passes on the retry, so Playwright
 * reports it as **1 flaky**, not a failure. That's the whole point: it
 * proves the retry configuration actually rescued a failing attempt,
 * without pretending the failure never happened.

   *      it — the per-block version of `fullyParallel`, so these two tests

   *      one, "Ostriches assemble" in the other) and asserts only on its
   *      own last data-testid="message-user" — neither may read anything
   *      the other wrote, or assert on a total count of messages.

   *      `--workers=1`. Same result both times, in either order — that's
   *      the property that makes sharding across CI runners safe.

   * Nothing to assert here; this one is reviewed on your PR.
   *
   *   1. Read `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`. Find the three things a
   *      Playwright job needs that `ci.yml` doesn't have, and say what each
   *      is for in your PR description.
   *   2. Reproduce the sharded run locally, exactly as the `e2e` and
   *      `report` jobs do it:
   *
   *        npx playwright test --shard=1/2 --reporter=blob
   *        npx playwright test --shard=2/2 --reporter=blob
   *        npx playwright merge-reports --reporter=html ./blob-report
   *        npx playwright show-report
   *
   *      Two runs, two blob reports, one merged HTML report. Include the
   *      final summary line of each shard in your PR description.
   *   3. Add one step to the `lessons` job in that workflow: upload
   *      `test-results/` (traces and videos, not just the HTML report) as
   *      an artifact named `lessons-traces`, with `if: always()` so it also
   *      runs when the tests failed. Commit it with your homework.
