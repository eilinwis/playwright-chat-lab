 * earlier lessons, capturing evidence about them this time instead of just
 * asserting on them.

 * You'll need `import fs from 'node:fs'` (for `fs.existsSync` /
 * `fs.statSync`) alongside the `@playwright/test` import once you start
 * writing — demo.spec.ts shows both APIs in action.

 * deleting its `test.fixme()` line once it passes.
