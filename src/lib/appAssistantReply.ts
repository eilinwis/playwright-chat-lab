/**
 * A small assistant scoped to this app itself,

 * intercepts a plain statement — every canned lesson/test message in this
 * repo is a plain statement, by design. The one exception is the bare word
 * "Help" (see HELP_SUGGESTION_MESSAGE) — an exact match, sent by the Help
 * suggestion chip, which lists every question below as a menu.

      'The Search screen does a full-text search over your local chat history — type a few words from something you sent earlier.',

    example: 'Why is this called Playwright Chat Lab?',

    example: 'Why is this good for testing?',
    reply:
      "This whole app is a purpose-built target for practicing Playwright end-to-end testing — every screen has data-testid's and predictable loading/disabled states specifically so it's easy to write reliable tests against.",

  {
    keywords: ['lesson', 'course', 'homework'],
    example: 'Where do I find the homework?',
    reply:
      "There's a full Playwright course in this repo's lessons/ folder — each lesson has a working demo.spec.ts and a homework.spec.ts exercise, using this very app as the system under test.",

    keywords: ['backend', 'api', 'llm', 'model'],
    example: 'Is there a real backend?',
    reply:
      "No real backend ships in this repo, so non-funny-mode replies fail by default. src/api/chatApi.ts implements the full GET /api/messages / POST /api/chat / POST /api/reset contract, so pointing it at a server of your own is all it takes.",
